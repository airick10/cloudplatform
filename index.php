	Hello!  Welcome to my Cloud portal page.  My name is Eric and I have been working with web design on my own for about twenty years.  I started exploring dynamic sites about ten years ago and have written up sites in PHP using a SQL Database in the background.  I am always tinkering with pages on my sites as I always enjoy learning new techniques and finding ways to make things run just a little bit better!<p>
	For quite some time, I was focused on getting my audience the data they need and simple navagation to get to where they need to go.  Styling was all just extra bells and whistles.  Now, I like putting a finishing touch on elements across the page to make it a rewarding experience across the site.  Like a grand symphony, it is quite rewarding to see all these langauges working together to make a wonderful site with useful information.<p>
	This is a demo site showing a web based platform to perform infrastructure operations.  The site works with dummy data with no acutal hypervisor infrastructure running behind the scenes.  Forms, buttons, and database relationships work just like a normal website.  No back-end code actually administers virtual servers in a cloud environment.  It's a demo!
